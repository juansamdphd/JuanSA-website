## Understand the basics of code (Google Digital Garage)

If you're a completey newbie to porgramming and tech, then his [free course](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/course/basics-code) will give a quick and easy introduction to code. Learn the basic concepts behind programmoing languages, their application, and why programming is not a thing of **hackers** anymore and a basic skills scientist, engineers, artist, and (honestly) anyone should be familiar with.

## Computational Thinking for Problem Solving (Coursera)

So you've learned why programming languages are so important and useful for our daily life, and I bet (or hope) there is fire in you instructing you to pick one of the over 250 programming languages available and master it.

But before going forward diving into your preferred programming language, why not get a sense of how to think computationally? If you are a scientist, you've been doing something similar for a while now, but with [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-thinking-problem-solving#syllabus) you will learn how to apply systematic approaches to problems using a computer.

Computational thinking is an important skill and someting I wish I had learned formally earlier in my life. I hope this course helps you kicking in this new gear in your brain. If you enjoy this course and its content, then make sure to check [this wonderful book](https://algorithmstoliveby.com/) by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths, "Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions".

ProTip: The audiobook version is a great companion for commuting or those long days at the bench or biosafety cabinet!
