# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "An interdisciplinary team made of neuroscientists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons, led by Dr. Mark Tuzynski at the University of California â€“ San Diego (UCSD, San Diego, CA), reported this past February in [*Nature Medicine*](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4502) the successful grafting of human spinal cord-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) into the spinal cord of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with high level (i.e., cervical) injuries. The grafts not only survived for at least 9 months post-injury, and but also developed large numbers of axons that traveled over long distances within the injured spinal cord and were also penetrated by host axons."
