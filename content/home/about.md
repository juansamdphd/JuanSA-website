# Biography

I am a _Neuroscience PhD Candidate_ at the University of Victoria. My research in the Swayne Lab looks to understand the role of Pannexin 1 (Panx1) during **postnatal cortical development**, using a combination of _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ models. My research interests include dendritic spine plasticity, synapse and neuronal network formation, and endogenous repair mechanisms. In addition to this, I play on my expertise on fluorescence confocal microscopy too support other developing projects in the Swayne Lab by acquiring high-resolution images, analyzing morphological metrics (using both manual and semi-automated methods), and providing statistical analysis guidance.

I am passionate about basic science and medicine, and I firmly believe that strong basic science foundations during medical training are key factors in the formation of newer generations of medical professionals. I hope to become a leading physician/scientist actively pursuing new molecular and cellular clues on brain function and brain connectivty in health and disease.
