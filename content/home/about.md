# About me

I am a _Neuroscience Researcher (RA)_ at the University of Victoria. My research in the Swayne Lab looks to understand the role of Pannexin 1 (Panx1) during **postnatal cortical development**, using a combination of _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ models and confocal fixed and live-cell microscopy. My research interests include dendritic spine plasticity, synapse and neuronal network formation, and endogenous repair mechanisms. Additionally, I contribute to other developing projects in the Swayne Lab by acquiring high-resolution images, analyzing morphological metrics (using both manual and semi-automated methods), and providing experimental design and statistical analysis support.

I am passionate about basic science and medicine. I am a firm believer that strong basic science foundations during medical training are key factors in the formation of newer generations of medical professionals. My goal is to become a leading physician/scientist actively pursuing clinical-informed basic science to understand the molecular substrates of neuronal network dysfunction in the injured nervous system.
