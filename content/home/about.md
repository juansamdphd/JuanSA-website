# Biography

Juan is a _Neuroscience PhD Candidate_ at the University of Victoria. His research in the Swayne Lab looks to understand the role of **Pannexin 1 (Panx1)** during postnatal cortical development, using a combination of _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ models. His research interests include dendritic spine plasticty, synapse and neuronal network formation, and endogenous repair mechanisms. By using his expertise on fuorescence confocal microcopy, Juan often supports other projects by acquiring high-resolution images, analyzing morphological metrics (using both manual and semi-automated methods), and providing statistical analysis guidance.

Juan is passionate about basic science and medicine, and truly believes that strong basic science foundations during medical training re key factors for the formation of newer generations of medical professionals. He hopes to combine both, as he learns and collect skills, to one day become a leader physician/scientist.
