# About me

I am a _Postdocotral Fellow_ at the University of Victoria. My research in the Swayne Lab has focused in understand the role of pannexin 1 (PANX1) during **postnatal cortical development** using confocal microscopy and other advanced microscopy techniques in fixed and living neurons. My research interests include dendritic spine plasticity, synapse and neuronal network formation,  endogenous repair mechanisms, and applying data science principles to cell biology. Additionally, I contribute to other projects in the Swayne Lab that require microscopy, image analysis, and statistical analysis support.

I am passionate about bridging basic science and medicine. I am a firm believer that strong basic science foundations during medical training are key factors in the formation of newer generations of medical professionals. My goal is to become a leading physician/scientist actively pursuing clinical-informed basic science to understand the molecular substrates of neuronal network dysfunction in the injured nervous system.
