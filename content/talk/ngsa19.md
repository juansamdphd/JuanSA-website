This powerful property is known as neuroplasticity. In this 10 min talk, I discuss about enhanced neuroplasticity waves during development (critical windows), how dendritic spines are the locus of structural and functional plasticity, and lastly, how social interaction are critical for neuroplasticity and learning using examples of birdsong and language acquisition in zebra finches and humans"
