abstract = "Background and Aim: Pannexin 1 (Panx1), one of the members of the pannexin channel-forming protein family, is highly enriched in the early postnatal brain. Work from our group has established that Panx1 regulates neurite outgrowth in vitro and interacts with multiple neuronal cytoskeletal elements, while work by others have associated Panx1 with synaptic plasticity. Based on these premises, we investigated the impact of Panx1 deletion on the formation of neuronal networks and dendritic spines, the microscopic protrusions that grow from dendrite shafts and enable excitatory neurotransmission between interconnected neurons.

Methods: We used Ca2+ imaging and in silico network analysis to investigate spontaneous neuronal network activity in wildtype (WT) and Panx1 KO primary cortical neuronal cultures. Because dendritic spines provide the structural basis for converging excitatory synapses and their formation is required to incorporate neurons into networks, we measured dendritic spines in WT and Panx1 (global and cortical-glutamatergic specific) KO layer 5 somatosensory pyramidal neurons labelled with a lipophilic dye, DiI, as well as in WT and Panx1 KO cortical neuronal cultures using phalloidin. In parallel, we also examined protein expression of postsynaptic glutamate receptors and the scaffolding-protein PSD-95 in synaptosome fractions from WT ad Panx1 KO cortices.

Results: Panx1 KO cortical cultures exhibited more and larger spontaneous groups of co-activated neurons, known as network ensembles. Based on our previous work demonstrating Panx1 negatively regulates neurite growth, we hypothesized that an increase in dendritic spine density could account for these network activity differences. Accordingly, Panx1 KO layer 5 somatosensory pyramidal neurons showed significant increases in spine densities at P14 and P29, a critical period for dendritic spine and synapse formation. Dendritic spine length was not different between groups, suggesting the additional spines in Panx1 KO neurons are of similar nature to those of WT littermates. Similar observations in Panx1 KO primary cortical neurons and our cortical-glutamatergic specific Panx1 KO demonstrated this dendritic spine phenomenon is cell-autonomous. Moreover, analysis of protein expression in synaptosome fractions revealed significant increases in PSD-95, GluA1, and GluN2A in Panx1 KO cortices.

Conclusion: Taken together, our findings point to a new role of Panx1 in the formation of neuronal networks by acting as a ‘brake’ for the development of dendritic spines in cortical neurons.
